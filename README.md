# A Monte Carlo Ray Tracer in C++ by Denny Lindberg and Molly Middagsfjell for the course TNCG15: Advanced Global Illumination and Rendering
This project uses:

**C++14** as the minimum standard

**premake5** for generating makefiles or solutions for the IDE - https://premake.github.io/download.html

**glad** for OpenGL bindings - https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad

**SDL2** for creating a cross-platform OpenGL window with input - https://www.libsdl.org

**glm** for vector and matrix data types compatible with OpenGL - https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.9/index.html

**lodepng** for loading and saving PNG files - https://lodev.org/lodepng/


# Gettings started

## Folder structure

**binaries/** - contains compiled executable. This is also the folder where you place program-related files such as dlls, images, configs or audio.

**include/** - thirdparty includes.

**libs/** - windows specific libs.

**source/** - main folder for our source code.

**temp/** - this folder is generated by premake5 and contains the solution. This folder can be deleted at any time.

## Install libs for SDL2 if you are not on Windows

Follow this guide for MacOSX: http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/01_hello_SDL/mac/index.php

## Get premake5 and generate the solution

Either place the premake5 executable in the root folder or in a system path. Then open CMD, the terminal or Git Bash and type one of the two commands below:

**Windows:** `premake5 vs2017` or `./premake5 vs2017`

**MacOSX:** `premake5 xcode4` or `./premake5 xcode4`

Whenever you do a `git pull` or add new files in the folder structure, re-run the premake command to update the solution. Most IDEs will detect the change and ask to update.

## Open the solution

Go to the `temp/` folder and open the generated solution file.
